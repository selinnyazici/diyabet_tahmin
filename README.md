This project is a diabetes prediction system made by using four machine learning algorithms for a school project. The goal is to find the model with the best F1 score on this dataset by comparing models reports and applying hyperparameter optimization. To prevent overfitting or underfitting, data preprocessing essentials like normalization, standardization and data downsampling have also been used.
Models used:
-KNN
-XGradient Boosting
-Support Vector Classifier
-Naive Bayes
